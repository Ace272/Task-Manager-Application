Yes, if you're using Maven as your build tool, you can compile and run your application using Maven commands. Here's how you can do it:

1. Compile: Maven will compile your source code and generate the necessary .class files.
bash

        mvn compile
2. Run: You can use the exec:java goal provided by the Maven exec plugin to run your application.
bash

        mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.myproject.app.CommandLineInterface"
This command tells Maven to execute the main method in the CommandLineInterface class within the com.myproject.app package.

Make sure your Maven pom.xml file is correctly configured with the necessary dependencies and plugins, including the exec-maven-plugin for executing Java code.

Once you run these commands, Maven will handle the compilation and execution of your Java application, including managing dependencies and classpaths as specified in your pom.xml file.
